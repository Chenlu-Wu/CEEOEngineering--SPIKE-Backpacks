### Step 1:
Plug in your SPIKE Prime.

### Step 2:
Choose one of the three options to program SPIKE Prime.
1.  Any terminal emulator
2.  Python code
3.  My IDE (written in LabVIEW)

#### OPTION #1: TERMINAL IDE

> 1. Grab a terminal emulator
>>1. CoolTerm works on all platforms, including Pi
>>2. Putty is good on windows
>>3. screen command in Terminal on a unix operating system

>2. Find your port
>>1. on mac, type ls /dev/tty.usbmodem
>>2. on a pc, look in your device manager under serial to see what serial ports you have connected
>>3. on pi, it will be something like ttyAMC0 - check in your /dev/ folder
